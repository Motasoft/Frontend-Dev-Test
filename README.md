# Frontend Dev Test Project

We would like you to build a simple component from the wireframe image (nasa.png) contained in this package. There is no right or wrong way to go about it. We want to see your approach to HTML, CSS, and Angular. Feel free to use any existing frameworks or libraries that you are comfortable with (e.g. bootstrap, fontawesome etc...).

The API end point is https://apodapi.herokuapp.com/search?search_query=mars&number=1&page=1. The refresh button should return a new image by randomly selecting a page number between 1 and 100.

# Deliverable
Please send us a copy of the build folder as well as the source code, as we'd love to see your approach to the project. Alternatively, create a repository to work on your component, and give us access to it!
